To run the program:

type in "make" in directory.
type ./Auction.
enter command "login" to get started.
enter any username in currentusers.txt.

main menu commands:
	
	advertise
	logout
	createuser
	deleteuser
	bid
	addcredits
	refundcredits

every iteration of commands takes you back to main menu, expect for logout.

to run the TEST scripts type  ./script.sh
if this does not work type "chmod +x script.sh" to the cmd line

If possible run each test seperately as they all use the same dailyTransaction file
When run seperately each test is succesful, this is how we got all successes for 
our failure logs.

**Some back end functionality has been implemented in addCredits and
 refundCredits but not in bid to help with phase 4.
 
 The extra spaces are not accounted for the .dtf, but the code does have bounds
 to account for character count**
